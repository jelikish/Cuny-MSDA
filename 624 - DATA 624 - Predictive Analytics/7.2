### 7.2

Chapter 7 talks about non leanier regressions. It goes over several models. specifically MARS, SVM and K-NN. Exersise 7.2 goes over evaluating different models and comparing the results to better understand how to chose the appropriate model for a specific situation.

Friedman (1991) introduced several benchmark data sets create by simulation.
One of these simulations used the following nonlinear equation to
create data:
y = 10 sin(??x1x2) + 20(x3 ??? 0.5)2 + 10x4 + 5x5 + N(0, ??2)
where the x values are random variables uniformly distributed between [0, 1]
(there are also 5 other non-informative variables also created in the simulation).
The package mlbench contains a function called mlbench.friedman1 that

We will preload the necessary libraries and generate the training and test data using mlbench as given

```{r}
library(mlbench)
set.seed(200)
trainingData <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
## We convert the 'x' data from a matrix to a data frame
## One reason is that this will give the columns names.
trainingData$x <- data.frame(trainingData$x)
## Look at the data using
featurePlot(trainingData$x, trainingData$y)
## or other methods.

 ## This creates a list with a vector 'y' and a matrix
 ## of predictors 'x'. Also simulate a large test set to
 ## estimate the true error rate with good precision:
 testData <- mlbench.friedman1(5000, sd = 1)
 testData$x <- data.frame(testData$x)
```
