Wright Brothers (51050), United States of America, Seattle, WashingtonAt Capital One, we're building a leading information-based technology company. Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking.

Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.
Data ScientistCapital One is a diversified bank that offers a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small business and commercial clients. Ranked #127 on the Fortune 500, Capital One has one of the most widely recognized brands in America. As one of the nation's top 10 banks, we offer a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. We nurture a work environment where people with a variety of thoughts, ideas and backgrounds, guided by our shared Values, come together to make Capital One a great company and a great place to work.
At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you'll be part of a team that's leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

-Using Hadoop and related tools (Pig, Hive, Impala) to manage the analysis of billions of customer transaction records

-Creating machine learning models from development through testing and validation to our 30+ million customers in production
-Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
-Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of mobile banking and the financial world of tomorrow

-Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. Expect to tell us what you've shipped and what's flopped.
-Fearless. Big, undefined problems and petabytes don't frighten you. You can work at a tiny crack until you've broken open the whole nut.
Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it's still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest folks you've ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.

Aflac Insurance Sales Agent
Aflac Insurance Sales Agent
While a career in sales may not be for everyone, those who have been successful say it's been one of the most rewarding ventures of their lives. So what do these people have in common? They're problem solvers. They share the desire to help people. And they have a good work ethic. As an independent consultant backed by Aflac, you have the opportunity to run your own business and do the things you love. Put in the work and reap the rewards. That being said, let's talk about your potential and what becoming an Aflac agent can mean to you. Of course, you probably recognize the Aflac Duck. But that's only scratching the surface.
Let's look at what our company really does. Aflac plays a vital role in helping people when they need it most when they're injured or ill.  Unlike major medical, Aflac pays benefits directly to customers (unless otherwise assigned) - so they have the financial security and control to handle whatever life brings.
Become a Strategic Consultant
You'll be the go-to benefit-solutions partner for businesses in your community.  As an Aflac associate, you will be a strategic advisor to companies and their employees. Your role will consist of helping business owners figure out the best way to insure employees and guiding individuals to choose the best benefits options.
We also have innovative tools to help you grow your business. Everwell is a web-based enrollment platform designed to enable agents to sell Aflac products, as well as major medical and other ancillary benefits from our partner carriers.
Work with a Winning Team
You'll be working alongside a group of bright, energetic people who are motivated to help you succeed. As part of our commitment to your development, we'll provide you with the training you'll need to help you grow and manage a successful team.
Become a Leader
Being an Aflac agent allows you to own your own business while making a difference. You'll have the opportunity to advance to a district sales coordinator role where you can grow and develop your own team.
The Opportunity to Give Back
When you join the Aflac sales team, you'll be part of a passionate and deep tradition of helping those in need in your community. For 20 years, Aflac has actively supported the fight against childhood cancer, and has raised over $100 million to support the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.1
Competitive Compensation
At Aflac we compensate our associates in several different ways including advanced commission, renewals, stock bonus, and a recruiting bonus. You'll also receive renewals after the first year with 50% vesting starting at only 2 years. That means as long as the policies you've sold continue to be renewed, you will continue to receive that income. There are also great opportunities to participate in contests where you can receive awards, trips, and prizes.
So if you're enthusiastic, self-motivated and have an entrepreneurial spirit apply today.

Data Engineer
THE JOB
New role, hired 2 data engineers in a past      year and building out team, need another person.
Ideally want someone with CS degree
Responsible for full cycle data      engineering: Modeling, reporting, doing ETL, program management and tying      it all together. Everything from gathering requirements, doing the initial      model to see if the ETL is going to be adapted, writing ETL code that      connects the  databases, and then at the very end there's some      reporting
They have their own tools (informatica,      hive, pig they're great but they use their own proprietary tools)
IMPORTANT: SQL, should be able to write      their own SQL code whereas a lot of people use tools to write it or lose      the ability to write it as they become senior (that kind of person won't      be able to fit into their environment)  very hands on role
Gathering requirements:
For an e commerce company they're always      testing their theories so they have a site that gets millions of visitors      so they collect a ton of data, ex. (what pages people are on, how long      they stay on them,  where they're hovering their mouse, where they      click, and they use their data teams to test theories so they want to      evaluate if they should expand business in a certain area they have them      test the theories. If they want to analyze where business has grown over      the past year they help them come up with a solution to figure that out.
In order to analyze you have to script,      can't do analysis without having to code
Remarks:
. People aren't hands on enough with SQL
. SQL performance tuning, it's one thing to know SQL it's another to know how to utilize it to get the job done. Performance tuning has been a huge issue.
. Give a hacker rank assessment first to gauge familiarity with SQL first, that weeds out about 9/10 candidates
. Next step phone screen w/ data architect. 1 out 5 make it through that step
. On site: 1/7-8 make it
. Mainly due to a volume problem, need to get more people in the door. Data engineers aren't that hard to find but the ones around here are mostly in finance or new, just getting into it, and don't quite meet their expectations most of the time
. For hacker rank they don't care about the right answers they care about approach with problem solving
. Note about their hiring process: expect candidates to fall into 1 or 2 main areas: 1 is a functional area, domain knowledge around data engineering, the other is in culture. They want to make sure someone can talk the talk and walk the walk and can provide examples of having been successful in the role and in their leadership principles.
. Candidates have to exceed their expectations to be hired, they have to be better than 50% of their current team before they get an offer. They look at current team and say is this person better than the people sitting in the room?
. That's the bar they set, it's not so much someone who can do the job but rather someone who can come in and enhance the team. They look at it holistically, not so much filling small gaps
. Submittal turn around
Will send the hacker rank to any one if they're comfortable

You'll work in one of our North American offices as part of McKinsey Digital Labs (MDL), part of our broader Digital McKinsey.
MDL is a specialized service that leverages latest technology disruptions (e.g., cloud, big data, mobile, agile, software development) and a team of talented technologists to rapidly build and deploy custom web and mobile Business intelligence applications for our clients. MDL works closely with our consultants and clients to develop a deep understanding of business needs and create tools that enable our clients to be more productive (e.g., equip frontline with mobile sales app)  and make timely decisions (e.g., management dashboards).  MDL end-products range from building iPad demos and dashboards, to embedding Excel models in existing client applications, to standing-up advanced analytics technology environments or SaaS solutions, and to building targeted web/mobile applications.
Despite being part of a large, multinational organization, our group works more like a small startup company. Our development teams are small, flexible, and employ agile methodologies to quickly provide our consultants with the solutions they need. We combine the latest open source technologies together with traditional Enterprise software products. Our office culture is casual, fun and social, with an emphasis on education and innovation. We have the freedom to try new ideas, experiment and are expected to be constantly learning and growing. There is also a strong emphasis on mentoring others in the group, enabling them to grow and learn.
What You'll Do
You will apply your passion for finding opportunities in data by using established tools and techniques, or by innovating new ones, to get insights from large complex data sets.
You will work on McKinsey client studies alongside highly talented business consultants to help them in various analyses and its implementation. The impact of the work is normally realized in a very short span of study duration, which is very satisfying and rewarding.  You'll also focus on learning new technologies and you'll contribute to knowledge sharing, usually through blogs or conferences.

Aflac Insurance Sales Agent
Aflac Insurance Sales Agent
While a career in sales may not be for everyone, those who have been successful say it's been one of the most rewarding ventures of their lives. So what do these people have in common? They're problem solvers. They share the desire to help people. And they have a good work ethic. As an independent consultant backed by Aflac, you have the opportunity to run your own business and do the things you love. Put in the work and reap the rewards. That being said, let's talk about your potential and what becoming an Aflac agent can mean to you. Of course, you probably recognize the Aflac Duck. But that's only scratching the surface.
Let's look at what our company really does. Aflac plays a vital role in helping people when they need it most when they're injured or ill.  Unlike major medical, Aflac pays benefits directly to customers (unless otherwise assigned) - so they have the financial security and control to handle whatever life brings.
Become a Strategic Consultant
You'll be the go-to benefit-solutions partner for businesses in your community.  As an Aflac associate, you will be a strategic advisor to companies and their employees. Your role will consist of helping business owners figure out the best way to insure employees and guiding individuals to choose the best benefits options.
We also have innovative tools to help you grow your business. Everwell is a web-based enrollment platform designed to enable agents to sell Aflac products, as well as major medical and other ancillary benefits from our partner carriers.
Work with a Winning Team
You'll be working alongside a group of bright, energetic people who are motivated to help you succeed. As part of our commitment to your development, we'll provide you with the training you'll need to help you grow and manage a successful team.
Become a Leader
Being an Aflac agent allows you to own your own business while making a difference. You'll have the opportunity to advance to a district sales coordinator role where you can grow and develop your own team.
The Opportunity to Give Back
When you join the Aflac sales team, you'll be part of a passionate and deep tradition of helping those in need in your community. For 20 years, Aflac has actively supported the fight against childhood cancer, and has raised over $100 million to support the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.1
Competitive Compensation
At Aflac we compensate our associates in several different ways including advanced commission, renewals, stock bonus, and a recruiting bonus. You'll also receive renewals after the first year with 50% vesting starting at only 2 years. That means as long as the policies you've sold continue to be renewed, you will continue to receive that income. There are also great opportunities to participate in contests where you can receive awards, trips, and prizes.
So if you're enthusiastic, self-motivated and have an entrepreneurial spirit apply today.

Aflac Insurance Sales Agent
Aflac Insurance Sales Agent
While a career in sales may not be for everyone, those who have been successful say it's been one of the most rewarding ventures of their lives. So what do these people have in common? They're problem solvers. They share the desire to help people. And they have a good work ethic. As an independent consultant backed by Aflac, you have the opportunity to run your own business and do the things you love. Put in the work and reap the rewards. That being said, let's talk about your potential and what becoming an Aflac agent can mean to you. Of course, you probably recognize the Aflac Duck. But that's only scratching the surface.
Let's look at what our company really does. Aflac plays a vital role in helping people when they need it most when they're injured or ill.  Unlike major medical, Aflac pays benefits directly to customers (unless otherwise assigned) - so they have the financial security and control to handle whatever life brings.
Become a Strategic Consultant
You'll be the go-to benefit-solutions partner for businesses in your community.  As an Aflac associate, you will be a strategic advisor to companies and their employees. Your role will consist of helping business owners figure out the best way to insure employees and guiding individuals to choose the best benefits options.
We also have innovative tools to help you grow your business. Everwell is a web-based enrollment platform designed to enable agents to sell Aflac products, as well as major medical and other ancillary benefits from our partner carriers.
Work with a Winning Team
You'll be working alongside a group of bright, energetic people who are motivated to help you succeed. As part of our commitment to your development, we'll provide you with the training you'll need to help you grow and manage a successful team.
Become a Leader
Being an Aflac agent allows you to own your own business while making a difference. You'll have the opportunity to advance to a district sales coordinator role where you can grow and develop your own team.
The Opportunity to Give Back
When you join the Aflac sales team, you'll be part of a passionate and deep tradition of helping those in need in your community. For 20 years, Aflac has actively supported the fight against childhood cancer, and has raised over $100 million to support the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.1
Competitive Compensation
At Aflac we compensate our associates in several different ways including advanced commission, renewals, stock bonus, and a recruiting bonus. You'll also receive renewals after the first year with 50% vesting starting at only 2 years. That means as long as the policies you've sold continue to be renewed, you will continue to receive that income. There are also great opportunities to participate in contests where you can receive awards, trips, and prizes.
So if you're enthusiastic, self-motivated and have an entrepreneurial spirit apply today.

Job DescriptionThe product catalog is a strategic asset for Amazon. It powers unrivaled product discovery, informs customer buying decisions, offers a huge selection across a large number of categories and positions Amazon as the first stop for shopping online. As an applied scientist in ASCS you will help us make the world's best product catalog even better and improve the experience for millions of customers.
You will analyze how information within Amazon's catalog affects our customers and help devise short term and long term strategy for expanding and enhancing the catalog. You will have the opportunity to design new data analytical workflows at a scale rarely available elsewhere, utilizing state-of-the-art data science and machine learning tools such as Spark, Python, and Theano and Amazon's cloud computing technologies such as Elastic Map Reduce (EMR), Kinesis, and Redshift.
You will apply your knowledge about data science by creating algorithmic solutions that combine techniques like clustering, pattern mining, predictive modeling, deep learning, statistical testing, information retrieval, and natural language processing and apply them to huge data amounts of data describing the products in the catalog and the customer interactions. You evaluate with scientific rigor and provide inputs to business strategy and technical direction. You will collaborate with software engineering teams to integrate your algorithmic solutions into large-scale highly complex Amazon production systems.
You will encounter many challenges, including
scale (build models for billions of products in the catalog utilizing trillions of customer interactions),
accuracy (extreme requirements for precision or recall due to impact of getting it wrong, e.g. extremely high precision for merging identical products or extremely high recall for identifying hazardous materials)
speed (generate predictions for millions of new or changed products with low latency),
diversity (products need to be classified into &gt100k's of categories across 16 languages),
high dimensionality (feature engineering and selection using 1k's of structured product features with millions of values, unstructured product data, product images, customer searches, clicks, reviews, etc.), and
noise (build models robust to varying quality of data provided by millions of sellers and labels derived implicitly or collected from humans).
You will need to be creative and go far beyond text book solutions to deal with these challenges. Meeting the business requirements will involve combining several different machine learning algorithms with domain knowledge into complex data analytical workflows that automate what can be automated and efficiently utilize experts when needed to mitigate risk.
You will help us to
Identify which product information matters most to our customers.
Extract product information from unstructured data to augment the catalog.
Consolidate spelling variations of product attributes like brand, size, or color.
Automatically classify new products with low latency into our highly detailed product categories.
Improve the categorization of our huge catalog with minimum manual effort.
Identify identical products and similar products such as different sizes and colors of the same shoe.
Identify restricted products such as hazardous materials.
Estimate the financial impact of catalog improvements.

Looking to develop innovative algorithm and software solutions for challenging real-world problems in entrepreneurial, collaborative, agile, multidisciplinary teams focused on advancing the state-of-the-art? You've found the right place!
The Adaptive Reasoning Technologies (ART) directorate is a cutting-edge, multidisciplinary research and engineering organization that is BAE Systems' lead for invention and application of innovative machine learning, control, and optimization approaches to learn patterns of behavior from a wide range of data sources, including real-time sensor feeds. We use these behavioral models for anomaly and change detection, prediction of future behavior, and recognition of complex events and activities. Applications of our technology include terrestrial, maritime, and space domains over a range of sensing modalities (e.g., radar, full motion video, radio communication) spanning the technology readiness spectrum from basic research through fielded operational systems. Our cutting edge projects and opportunities advance the frontiers of science as well as contributing to practical systems that solve real problems.
We are seeking a highly creative Research Scientist to contribute to the development of advanced algorithms and systems in diverse research areas applying machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, adaptive control, and/or optimization to cutting edge problems such as learning normal behavior patterns of tracked entities (e.g., dismounts, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, satellites, software-defined radios, cyber system users and hosts) to detect anomalous activity or changes in patterns, predict future behavior, or provide advance warning of impending threats to friendly assets. You must be highly motivated, have solid problem-solving abilities, and be willing to perform a wide variety of related tasks.
You must be a team player with a proactive attitude and the capacity to be creative and productive in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. You must have strong writing and general communication skills, and strong presentation skills are a definite plus. You may participate in meetings with customers, co-contractors, and/or sub-contractors. Some travel may be required to support customer or collaborator meetings, software integration and testing, and/or capability demonstrations.
Our ideal Research Scientist is a strong entrepreneur who can develop novel adaptive incremental data-driven model learning and exploitation algorithms, present those ideas to colleagues and customers, write winning proposals, and then execute projects when awarded. You must have a desire to create and/or sustain lines of research by participating in proposal writing and other marketing efforts with research funding agencies such as DARPA. Typically our project workflow involves: (1) researching solutions developed in-house or published in scientific literature to determine applicability and identify strengths and weaknesses; (2) creating prototypes (typically in MATLAB) to support demonstration and evaluation of key algorithmic ideas on (often real) data; and (3) developing robust, real-time implementations suitable for target hardware/software environments. You must be able to: (1) provide research and technical leadership as well as hands-on algorithm design, implementation, and evaluation; (2) quickly adapt to changing requirements; and (3) be involved in all workflow stages. Ultimately, you would be leading a team of dedicated research, software, and system engineers to execute your vision of the program you developed!
As a successful candidate, you: (a) will participate in small teams of research, software, and (potentially) systems engineers that may include members from collaborating universities, other companies, and customer organizations; and (b) will interact directly with customers to participate in design reviews, support integration, testing, and demonstration, and/or produce clear, user-friendly documentation. Solid general written and oral communication skills are critical to your professional success in this role.
U.S. citizenship is required, as is an active TS security clearance, and a current SCI clearance is very strongly preferred. Work for this position will be performed in the Metropolitan DC/Virginia area.
Required education: Doctorate in Computer Science or Engineering-related discipline with or without professional experience (specialization in Machine Learning, Statistics, Computational Neuroscience, and/or Controls and Optimization particularly valuable); Masters degree with 3+ years professional experience; Bachelors Degree with 5+ years experience
- U.S. citizenship is required, as is an active TS security clearance, and a current SCI clearance is very strongly preferred
- Work for this position will be performed in the Metropolitan DC/Virginia area
- Solid experience leading exploratory research and development efforts including monitoring and guidance of team member activities

- Track record of experience demonstrating detailed knowledge (including understanding of strengths and weaknesses of various approaches), application, analysis, and development in at least one of machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, adaptive control, and/or optimization
- Solid analytic and project and personnel leadership skills
- Strong writing and presentation skills sufficient to support: (a) creation and sustainment of lines of research through marketing via direct interaction with customers and proposal writing; and (b) publication of research results in professional, peer-reviewed journals and technical conferences
- MATLAB proficiency to perform: (1) rapid design, prototyping, analysis, and simulation of, and experimentation with, advanced algorithms and applications; and (2) data analysis
- Equally effective communication with lifelong academics, government customers, and professional engineers
- Supervision/mentorship of junior staff
- Record of publications will be viewed favorably

Amazon hires people from all types of backgrounds, into positions based all over the world. We recruit the best and brightest.
Sr. Machine Learning Scientist
Want to be a core member of the next revolution in online payments? Payments on the internet today look largely like they did fifteen years ago, in contrast to every other part of the web. At Amazon we have figured out how to build a massively-scalable payment eco-system. Now we want to bring it to the world and launch the next set of big innovations in the industry! Amazon Payments' vision is that every Amazon customer will pay with Amazon Payments every time and every place s/he transacts anywhere online. You will play a leading role in building the only 1 billion plus on-boarding, account management, and monitoring platform in the world. Our product will seamlessly recognize a billion customers across online and offline channels, mobile, and other connected devices (Omni-channel) recognize their needs, tailor Amazon services to their preferences, and identify patterns of customer behavior to reward and rebuke. To succeed, we will need to identify hundreds of thousands of typologies/behavioral patterns for several billions of customers by mining data collected at point of sales, and every device they used to consume Amazon services. You will be working with data from 1 out of 7 people in the world, 1 out of 3 people on the internet, today. To make this happen, suspicious activity detection technology needs to be re-defined and scaled to a whole other dimension, allowing us to separate the good from the evil effectively, which is where you come into the picture!
Machine learning and data science present a powerful solution to the current problems facing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programs. As a machine learning scientist, you will leverage your machine learning and advanced data science skills to identify, detect, and prevent Anti-Money Laundering modus operandi. This includes building behavior-centric models for seller and buyer activity, classifying transaction activity of customers with similar traits (business type, geographic location, age, etc.), clustering customers with similar transactions behavior, and identifying outliers from the crowd. You will also build systems that leverage unique storage systems such as graph database technologies, and build a sophisticated rules management platform for our compliance and risk evaluations.
At the end of the day, we make the world a better place by preventing unlawful activity on our platform, and making it easier for normal sellers and buyers to safely and seamlessly conduct their business. Join us in building platforms and products to protect Amazon and its customers by keeping unlawful activity off Amazon, and then scale your solutions to the exponential growth of Amazon. We are successful when we enable Amazon internal and external customers and sellers to more frictionlessly use our products including Selling on Amazon, Login & Pay with Amazon, Mechanical Turk, and AWS products. And the list is only increasing! The successful candidate will look at the big picture from both a business and technical perspective, and lead the organization in developing new software to support Amazon businesses.
Some things you might like about our team that's different from others: Our future is machine learning in native AWS. Our team is growing substantially over 2016 and 2017. It's still Day 1, and you have an opportunity to be involved in establishing a platform team that is critical to existing businesses and an enabler for new product launches. We have extremely low operations burden, no legacy software, all of which enables us to focus on strategy and building software. As a leader in our space, you get to put on the strategic hat, work across orgs and consult with the best ML leaders in the world across the company to determine our path forward, and re-define how the Anti-Money Laundering problem is solved. Last but not least, we operate like a startup, and you get to step up as a more senior leader quickly if you chose to!AML is just one machine learning application area. With the exponential Amazon business growth, we will have new lands to explore, which means unlimited career growth for you!

About Uline
Uline -  The Shipping Supply Specialists. It's not something we do, it's something we are. An industry leader, Uline is experiencing tremendous growth. In business for 36 years, we've grown to over 31,000 products and a 700+ page catalog.
In 1980, after recognizing a local need for a shipping supply distributor, Liz and Dick Uihlein started Uline from their basement. Their first product was the H-101 carton sizer (still offered today). It sold far beyond their expectations and encouraged the Uihleins to add more and more products.
Uline's Corporate Headquarters is in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, located between Chicago and Milwaukee. Today, with over 4,700 employees across North America, Uline has distribution centers in the U.S. in Chicago, Minneapolis, Allentown, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, and Seattle, in Canada in Toronto and Edmonton and in Mexico in Monterrey and Mexicali.
